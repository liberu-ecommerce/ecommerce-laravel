# Stable Release Implementation Tasks

## Purpose
This document defines the minimum implementation tasks required for a stable customer release of the ecommerce platform.

## Release Readiness Principles
- Core customer journeys must work end-to-end (browse, cart, checkout, order confirmation).
- Admin users must have reliable operational control (catalog, inventory, orders, settings).
- Platform setup must be reproducible in local and server environments.
- Security, tenancy boundaries, and authentication flows must be production-safe.

## Priority Levels
- `P0`: Must be completed before release.
- `P1`: Should be completed for launch quality.
- `P2`: Can ship in immediate post-release patch if needed.

## Cross-Cutting Stabilization Checklist

### Testing (`P0`)
- Add/complete feature tests for cart, checkout, orders, auth reset, and tenancy boundaries.
- Add unit tests for pricing, inventory mutation logic, and slug generation.
- Add regression tests for known production-risk paths.

### Security (`P0`)
- Verify authorization policies on admin and tenant-scoped endpoints.
- Validate CSRF, input validation, and output escaping on critical forms.
- Review password reset and social login attack surfaces.

### Data Integrity (`P0`)
- Validate DB constraints (foreign keys, unique keys, nullable correctness).
- Ensure transactions wrap multi-step writes in checkout/inventory/order flows.
- Validate idempotency for retryable operations.

### Observability (`P1`)
- Add structured logs for checkout, inventory, and external integrations.
- Ensure actionable error reporting for failed jobs and exceptions.
- Add baseline dashboard/alerts for checkout failure rate and low stock.

## Suggested Delivery Phases
1. Phase 1 (Release blockers): Items `P0` + cross-cutting `P0` checklist.
2. Phase 2 (Launch quality): Items `P1` + observability improvements.
3. Phase 3 (Hardening patch): Remaining `P2` items and optimization backlog.

## Exit Criteria for Stable Customer Release
- All `P0` items are implemented, tested, and signed off.
- No open critical/high severity defects in cart, checkout, orders, auth, or tenancy.
- Installation and deployment runbook validated in a fresh environment.
- Product owner and QA approval for core customer and admin workflows.
