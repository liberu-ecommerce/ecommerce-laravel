/**
 * Registration and /app access are one problem, not two.
 *
 * Registration was broken — CreateNewUser assigned a `staff` role that no seeder
 * creates (RolesSeeder dropped it in cf711cb without touching the caller), and on
 * an unseeded database Team::first() returned null and fatally errored first. That
 * bug was the only thing keeping strangers out of /app, because canAccessPanel
 * ended `return true; // TODO` and assignOrCreateTeam attached every registrant to
 * Team::first() — the merchant's own team.
 *
 * So fixing registration alone would have opened the door. These tests pin both
 * halves together: a registrant gets no team and no role, and /app requires a team.
